# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website.

It serves as a space to showcase projects, experiments, and ideas, as well as to explore design, interaction, and modern web development patterns. The site is intentionally flexible and evolving, with room for iteration over time.

## Overview

- Personal projects and work
- Experimentation with layout, animation, and UI
- Built to be simple, responsive, and fast
- Designed with a modern aesthetic in mind

## Tech

The site is built using modern web technologies and frameworks. Specific tools and libraries may change as the project evolves.

## Status

This project is a work in progress and will continue to be updated as I refine ideas, add projects, and improve the overall experience.
